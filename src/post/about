**** About ****

safepaste is a security-conscious paste service for sharing private, encrypted
data. All encryption is done client-side and it's impossible for the server,
admin, or anyone without your 256 bit key to view the paste. All pastes are
encrypted using AES-256.

**** Features ****

* AES-256 with random 256 bit secret keys
* Always over HTTPS
* Optional "burn after reading"
* Always free

**** Burn after reading ****

When selected, "burn after reading" will ensure that only one person will ever
read your paste. The paste will live for the default length of one day, but
will be atomically destroyed should anyone view it. Use this to ensure your
paste doesn't mingle after it's been read.

**** How it works ****

Upon pasting, your browser will generate a random 256 bit secret key. Using
that key, and AES-256, your paste is encrypted before it's sent to the server.
The server will reply with a 64 bit identifier for your paste; from there, you
share your paste by linking to the encrypted data and specifying your secret
key as the hash in the URL.

Here's a breakdown of an example link:

https://safepaste.org/99c14048#623e8078679c1d53d141bab759380e2fbc4689c95861971c5d5c2517516b96aa

Paste ID: 99c14048
Secret key (hash): 623e8078679c1d53d141bab759380e2fbc4689c95861971c5d5c2517516b96aa

The hash section of the URL, after the #, is never sent to the server; it's
used only by the browser and safepaste takes advantage of that to store the
secret key. Note, your paste is unreadable to anyone without that secret key.
As soon as you share the link containing that key, however, anyone who sees it
can read your paste. Share your links cautiously.
