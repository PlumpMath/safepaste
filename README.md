# safepaste

safepaste is a security-conscious paste service for sharing private, encrypted data. All encryption is done client-side and it's impossible for the server, admin, or anyone without your 256 bit key to view the paste. All pastes are encrypted using [AES-256](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard).

Find it online [here](https://safepaste.org).
